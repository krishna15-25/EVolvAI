# EVolvAI: Generative Learning & Evolution Framework

> **Autonomous Evolution of Generative Core Architectures.**

EVolvAI is a specialized framework designed to automate the training and architectural evolution of generative AI models. By leveraging an environment-graph based data pipeline, the system dynamically adapts its generative core to optimize for specific output domains, from synthetic data generation to dashboard-driven model monitoring.

## 🚀 The Core Concept: Self-Optimizing Nets
Traditional generative models require manual hyperparameter tuning and architecture design. EVolvAI introduces an evolutionary layer that monitors model performance via a frontend dashboard and feeds structural "mutations" back into the generative core.

## 🛠️ Key Components
- **Generative Core**: The primary model architecture undergoing training and evolution.
- **Environment Graph**: A structured representation of the training data and its relationships, enabling complex context-aware generation.
- **Frontend Dashboard**: Real-time visualization of model fitness, loss curves, and architectural changes.
- **Data Pipeline**: Automated ingestion and sanitization of domain-specific datasets.

---

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

- **Training Engine**: PyTorch-based training loops with integrated checkpointing.
- **Evolutionary Controller**: Genetic algorithms that optimize model topology.
- **Dashboard API**: Lightweight interface for piping metrics to the frontend.
